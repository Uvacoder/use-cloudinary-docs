Before you jump into using these hooks, let's dive into a few key pieces that will help get you up and running with Cloudinary in your React apps.

First, go and create an account with [Cloudinary](https://www.cloudinary.com)

Once your account is created, you'll see your `cloud name` in the top right corner of your console. This cloud name is neccessary to let our hooks know where to find the media we're going to be accessing.

Next, another important chunk of information to get acquainted with is Cloudinary's [Image](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_transformation_reference) and [Video](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/video_transformation_reference) transformation options. These options can be utilized through most of the hooks to decide what your media should look like when we request it. 

Lastly, these hooks are built over top of the [Cloudinary JS SDK](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/javascript_integration), so it's a great reference for what types of options can be fed into functions.

After that, you are ready ðŸš€
